Description: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is widely used in Life Science
    research. The package (<doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00684>) converts 1D 
    or 2D data into a matrix of values suitable for further data analysis and
    performs basic processing steps in a reproducible way. Negative values, a
    common issue in such data, are replaced by positive values. All used
    parameters are stored in a readable text file and can be restored from that
    file to enable exact reproduction of the data at a later time.
